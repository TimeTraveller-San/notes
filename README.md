# My Notes 
I am convinced that I have really bad memory so these notes are like checkpoints for my memory regarding the interesting stuff i keep studying

They may also have:

- Things i keep messing up
- I need to practice
- I need to understand later
- Resources I need to read in future
- and other stuff 


This is pretty much like an online notepad which may turn out to be useful to someone
